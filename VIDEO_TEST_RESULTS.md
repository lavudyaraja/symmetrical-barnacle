# Video Display Test Results

## Current Status
I've made several improvements to fix the video display issue:

### 1. ✅ Updated EnhancedPost Component
- Added `media_type` parameter to the function signature
- Passed `media_type` to PostProps
- Updated video detection logic to use `media_type` field

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Video Rendering
- Added visible "VIDEO" indicator badge on video posts
- Improved video controls (enabled controls)
- Added play button overlay on hover
- Better visual feedback for video content

### 3. ✅ Database Migration
- Created migration to update existing posts with correct `media_type`
- Video detection based on file extensions for existing posts
- Fallback to 'image' for posts without proper classification

### 4. ✅ Improved Video Detection
- Primary: Uses `media_type` field from database
- Fallback: File extension detection for older posts
- Supports all major video formats

## What Should Happen Now

1. **New Video Uploads**: Will be properly tagged with `media_type: 'video'`
2. **Video Display**: Shows with video controls and "VIDEO" badge
3. **Existing Videos**: Need the migration script run to update `media_type`

## Testing Steps

1. **Upload a new video** - should work immediately
2. **Check existing video posts** - may need migration update first
3. **Look for "VIDEO" badge** in top-left corner of video posts
4. **Video controls** should be visible and functional

## Potential Issues

If videos still don't appear correctly, it might be because:

1. **Existing posts need migration**: Run the migration script to update old posts
2. **Browser compatibility**: Some video formats may not be supported
3. **File URLs**: Supabase storage URLs might not have clear extensions

## Next Steps

1. Test uploading a new video file
2. Check if the "VIDEO" badge appears
3. If old videos still don't work, run the migration script
4. Check browser console for any error messages
